This is not the best calculator ok

Here are some of the features:

1. No buttons(only the calculate one) The numbers are inputted with number inputs and the operations are selected.
2. A bit the the CSS is i think from Neumorphism.
3. There is some background repeating. I am not a master at CSS.
4. And the background file is from Haikei.
5. If you type in 0 Divided by 0 then it will just output NaN (Not a Number)
6. There are some console.logs in the js if i remember.
